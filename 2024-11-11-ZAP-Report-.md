## Alert Detail



### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``
* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 3

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

#### CWE Id: [ 1021 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1021.html)


#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `email`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=email
userValue=zaproxy@example.com
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:8000`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### [ Information Disclosure - Sensitive Information in URL ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10024/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The request appeared to contain sensitive information leaked in the URL. This can violate PCI and most organizational compliance policies. You can configure the list of strings for this check to add or remove values specific to your environment.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `email`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `zaproxy@example.com`
  * Other Info: `The URL contains email address(es).`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `password`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `The URL contains potentially sensitive information. The following string was found via the pattern: pass
password`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/%3Fage=1&email=zaproxy%2540example.com&password=ZAP&username=ZAP
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `username`
  * Other Info: `The URL contains potentially sensitive information. The following string was found via the pattern: user
username`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Do not pass sensitive information in URIs.

### [ Modern Web Application ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10109/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The application appears to be a modern web application. If you need to explore it automatically then the Ajax Spider may well be more effective than the standard one.

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `<script>

            event.preventDefault();
            const formData = new FormData(event.target);
            const data = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());

            const response = await fetch('/register', {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {

                },
                body: JSON.stringify(data)
            });

            if (response.ok) {
                alert('Registration successful!');
            } else {
                alert('Registration failed.');
            }
        });
    </script>`
